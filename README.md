# P4 DNA LinkStrand


This program experiments with different implementations of a simulated restriction enzyme (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme) cleavage of a DNA molecule (or cleaving) of a DNA molecule. The simulation is a simplification of the chemical processes but provides an insight into the low-level processes.
